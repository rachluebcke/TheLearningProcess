		Dear friends,
	</h1>
		<p>
		This is a letter of sorts that I will write to my friends as I learn to code. Welcome to the trip.It's a motivation tactic of sorts. Dan Ariely calls it reward substitution. You can learn more about that in the first 10 min of <a href="http://youtu.be/V1AsL8_cifk">this video.</a> Essentially, all it means is that I'm taking something that is long-term important/meaningful to me but somewhat difficult (learning to code) and giving myself a short-term reward (talking to my friends).

		</p>
		<p>
		The first person to see this will probably be my good friend Betsy. What do you think, Bets? If you or anyone else is interested in writing back, let me know. Just a reminder that these wont really be private bc I'm not paying for a private github... so don't share all my secrets!!! </p>
		<p>
		I'm having a bit of a problem getting the h1 to display inline with the nav ul... So I'll try to solve that guy next time, or if you want you could help me out and then show me how ya fixed it. If you want to write back on a separate page just add another html file to the folder and link it to the LearningProcess.css stylesheet. Then add your hyperlink to one of the li links on this page. That make sense?
		who is in?
		</p>
		<p>
		Ps. I have made two more friends who are learning how to code and if they figure out github I might add them too. So, if this sounds horrid to you, no pressure. I just have no other reason to make a website at the moment... the content will be far more interesting than talking code in the future, though. :) I promise.
		</p>

	<!-- To add more pages to your site, just save new .html files into your directory. For example, you are using index.html right now for your home page (good choice!), so for another page, just save and create a new html file as "page2.html" or something similar. Then, link in your pages with the <a href="/page2.html">Click Me for another page!</a> tag. As long as your actual files are pushed to your github, you should be good. You are welcome to take a look at my embenedict.github.io project to see how I linked my files. -->
